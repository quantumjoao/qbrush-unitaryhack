# qbrush-unitaryhack

Can you paint the next Mona Lisa with qubits? 


What if we could paint with entanglement, qubits, and interactions? Our project explores the intersection of art and quantum computing by reimagining a traditional brush in a quantum context. We’ve developed a simple image manipulation app where users can create brush strokes, and now we’re taking it further by transforming those strokes with quantum algorithms.
 
Here are the rules:
- The quantum brush effect must stay (mostly) within the stroke area.
- It must include at least one strength knob, where setting it to zero results in no changes.
- The effect must be NISQ-friendly and simulatable on a standard laptop.

 
The rest is up to you! Encode colors as quantum states, use a fast brush to apply extra Hadamard gates, or manipulate alpha channels with CNOTs. Let your creativity and quantum skills shine!
